<h2>🌱 My Current Learning Path:</h2>

  1. First I will start with the basics of Web Dev, which includes working with HTML, CSS, JS, Node, React, MongoDB, Web3, and DApps. 
     This will be at an  introductory-novice level.
  
  2. Practice C++ while making a game in UE5.
  
  <b> ^^^ I'm currently on these steps ^^^ </b>
  
  3. Afterwards, I will learn more about Version control, Git & GitHub.
  
  4. Thirdly, focus on React more in depth.
  
  5. Learn and work - NodeJS.
  
  6. More experience with databases, learn and master MongoDB dev for web and mobile apps. 
  
  7. Learn how to write tests for JS projects.
  
  8. Learn Next.js and build ReactJS apps with NextJS framework.
  
  9. Master Python by doing the 100 Days of Code.
  
  10. Study for AWS Certified Cloud Practictioner.
  
  11. Docker & Kubernetes. I almost looked into this for my machine learning capstone project.
  
  12. Quick course in Linux if not done by this point.



<h2> Why? </h2> 

  <b> Just because I graduated doesn't mean that I'm done with learning. I have much more to learn! </b>
